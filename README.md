# ECS170AStarSearch]
Uses A* search (similar to Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm but has better performance)  to find a path from a start point to an end point, while minimizing the search space. The terrain is a mountain where each point is of varying heights. .Created an admissible  heuristic for an exponential cost function that chose a direction to move in depending on cost functions and the surrounding 8 neighbors. The heuristic was to move in a diagonal line starting at the start point until the x-coordinate or y-coordinate was equivalent to the x-coordinate or y-coordinate of the goal point. Then to move from that point in a straight line towards the goal point. Created another admissible heuristic for the division cost function. The heuristic obeyed the Triangular Inequality and  used the Euclidean distance from the start point to the end point as the shortest path.
